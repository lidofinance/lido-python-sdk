This repo provides a scratch of a Python project. Its purpose is to serve as starting point for
the development of a Python project based on a minimal working structure.

## Development
Clone project:
```bash
git clone git@github.com:lidofinance/lido-python-sdk.git
cd lido-python-sdk
```
Create virtual env:
```bash
virtualenv .env --python=python3
source .env/bin/activate
```
Install all dependencies:
```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
```

## How to test
Simply run in project root directory:
```bash
pytest .
```

## Covered features
